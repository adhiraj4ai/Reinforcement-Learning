In Monte Carlo Methods, an episode refers to a sequence of states, actions and rewards that an agent experiences through interaction with the environment. The episode starts from an initial state and continues until terminal state. \n",

    "### Monte Carlo Prediction of Action Values\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model of the environment is available, state values are enough to determine a policy, which is exactly we did in Dynamic Programming. But without a model, state values alone are not sufficient, and it is particularly useful to estimate action values. One must explicitly estimate the value of each action for an agent in a state to find optimal policy. Thus, with Monte Carlo we aim to estimate $Q*$. Policy evaluation problem for action values is to estimate A_\\pi(s, a), the expected return when starting in state $s$, taking action and thereafter following policy $\\pi$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A state-action pair ($s$, $a$) is said to be visited in an episode if ever the state $s$is visited and action $a$ is taken being in state $s$. Similar to state values, this give rise to two scenarios - **First Visit MC method** and **Every Visit MC method**. The **FVMC** method computes the average returns only after the first occurrence of visiting a state and selecting an action within each episode. Succeeding visit of state-action pairs are completely ignored. In contrast, the **EVMC** method computes the value of state-action pair by averaging the returns observed after every instance it is visited throughout all episodes.  These method converge quadratically to the true expected values as the number of visits to each-action pair becomes very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deterministic policies, where actions are chosen consistently for each state, many state-action pairs may never be visited, making it impossible to improve estimates for those actions. This poses a serious problem because the purpose of learning action values is to help in choosing among all possible actions in each state, not just the favored one. This is the general problem of exploration vs exploitation (or maintaining exploration ). In order to insure continual exploration and approximately accurate evaluation of action values, one approach is to guarantee that all state-action pairs are visited infinitely often by starting episodes from randomly chosen state action pairs i.e. every state-action pair has some non-zero probability of being selected as initial of episode. This strategy is known as exploring starts. However, it is not always practically possible to control the starting conditions for some environment, particularly when learning directly from action interaction with an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common alternative approach to ensure encountering all state-action pairs is to employ stochastic policies, where there’s a chance of selection any action in each state. This approach atleast guarantees exploration by allowing every action to be chosen with some probability."

Rather than just  predicting or estimating the value function for a given policy, it focus on the goal of finding an optimal control policy, thus called `Control`. The agent aims to learn an optimal policy through iterative policy evaluation and policy improvement steps. The policy evaluation step estimates the value function for the current policy, which represent the expected future reward for each state when following that policy. THe policy improvement step then updates the policy by choosing actions which maximize the expected future reward in each state.

The agent generates episodes by following a fixed policy (e.g., the current estimate of the optimal policy) from these initial states. The agent updates its value function and policy based on the complete episodes, using techniques like Monte Carlo policy evaluation and policy improvement. This method can be effective when the problem domain has a well-defined starting point or set of starting points.\n",

    "A policy that selects the best action available at the moment is known as a greedy policy. For example in any state we have an option to choose left, right, up and down in grid world and value for these actions is 3, 4, 2, 1 respectively. The greedy policy selects the best action having maximum Q value i.e. *right*. Problem with this approach is that agent never explores the other possible actions. But it is likely that the other possible action may lead to optimal policy. So, this gives rise to the question whether the agent should explore other actions as well or follow the same action with maximum $Q$ value always. This is known as the ***Exploration-Exploitation problem***. \n",

    "Exploration refers to the process of trying new actions or visiting unexplored states in the environment. This is necessary because the agent initially has incomplete knowledge about the environment dynamics and rewards. By exploring, the agent can discover new information, potentially leading to better policies or higher rewards in the long run.\n",

    "> **Exploitation:**\n",
    "Exploitation refers to the process of utilizing the agent's current knowledge to select actions that are expected to maximize the reward based on the information gathered so far. This is important because the agent's objective is to maximize its cumulative reward, and exploiting the current knowledge can lead to higher rewards in the short term. \n",

    "The exploration vs. exploitation dilemma arises because these two objectives are often in conflict. If the agent explores too much, it may miss out on opportunities to exploit its current knowledge and maximize immediate rewards. On the other hand, if the agent exploits too much, it may get stuck in a sub-optimal policy or fail to discover potentially better actions or states.\n",

    "To avoid this, among various technique, we use MC technique without exploration starts which decides on exploration and exploitation probabilistically. This is known as **MC with $\\epsilon$-greedy policy** where all actions are assigned some non-zero probability i.e. different actions other than one with maximum $Q$ value are assigned $\\epsilon$ probability value and action with maximum $Q$ value is assigned $1-\\epsilon$ probability.
